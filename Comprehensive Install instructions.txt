To set up the hardware:
1. Copy the entire RUSpy directory to your desktop.
2. Copy the entire contents of the "RUS Spectrometer Firmware" directory to a blank 4 to 16 GB microsd card and insert it into the RUS008 spectrometer.
3.For temperature controllers, select one of the three folders such as "High Temperature Option" , connect the controller, and start the Arduino IDE, find and load missing libraries if needed, and download to the controller the project.
4.Go to the "Windows" folder and run RUSpy.exe.

If you wish to modify the code, please rename it before you do.

Building SD card image zip file:

source helpers/build-all.sh


Getting started
Download SD card image zip file.
Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
Optionally, to start one of the applications automatically at boot time, copy its start.sh file from apps/<application> to the topmost directory on the SD card.
Install the micro SD card in the Red Pitaya board and connect the power.
Applications can be started from the web interface.
